## Track - Electronics Fundamentals Using the BBC micro:bit 

This section lists the content covered under the Electronics Fundamentals using the BBC micro:bit track.

This course is designed to run through two entire terms (10-12 weeks each term) assuming that one lesson is worked upon at every class.
