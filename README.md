## What Is A CoderDojo

CoderDojo is a global movement of free, volunteer-led, community based programming clubs for young people. We are the Altona North (Melbourne, Australia) chapter of this amazing initiative!

At CoderDojo Altona North, young people aged between 7 and 17, learn how to code (Scratch, Python, etc.), interact with the real world using sensors and the Arduino, develop programs on the Raspberry Pi, develop websites, develop mobile apps, develop simple programs, develop games, build robots and explore various aspects of technology in an informal, safe, and creative environment. In addition to learning to code, exploring the basics of electronics and robotics, attendees meet like minded people and are exposed to a world of possibilities of technology. An individuals creativity is the only limit. 

At CoderDojo Altona North our aim is to Ignite, Inspire and Create. We strongly believe that every child is a born  maker. What she/he needs is the right environment to Ignite those interests and Inspire them to Create. At CoderDojo Altona North there is a strong focus on community, peer learning, youth mentoring and self led learning, with an emphasis on showing how coding, making and hacking is a force for change in the world.

We might consider folowing a syllabus where it makes sense, especially with our young makers who are getting started. With the more experienced makers we will let the kids choose what they want to work on, and the mentors guide and help them along their journey of discovery into the world of technology. Some of the things we do at CoderDojo Altona North include:

- Coding in Scratch
- Python developing on the Raspberry Pi
- Minecraft development
- Inteacting with sensors and Arduino
- Interacting with sensors and RaspberryPi 
- Coding in HTML & CSS (websites)
- Development of simple mobile apps

You can read more about the CoderDojo movement at [CoderDojo.com](https://coderdojo.com/about/).

## Who Runs The CoderDojo

CoderDojo's are run by volunteers and are 100% free. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, you can write to us at altona-north-dojo at practicalperformanceanalyst dot com. 

## What Do I Need To Bring Along

Please bring along the following items - 

- A laptop. Borrow one from mum/dad if needs be.
- Any hardware you want to hack with during the dojo i.e. Arduino Uno, Arduno MEGA 2560, Raspberry Pi, etc.
- A parent! (Very very important). If you are 12 or under, your parent must stay with you during the entire session.
- Also important is intent to learn, make and create...:)

So come join us, have fun and share in the learning. Let's Ignite the flame of learning, let's inspire the maker in you and let's get creating!!!!

## Howto Book A Seat

To book at seat at the CoderDojo please visit [CoderDojo Altona North Booking Page](https://zen.coderdojo.com/dojos/au/altona-north-victoria/altona-north-junior-hackers). 

Seats are limited, so please make sure you have reserved a seat for the session. 

## Can I Volunteer & Inspire 

Are you keen to be part of an amazing global movement? Are you keen to help craft the Australian tech minds of tomorrow in your local community? If so, then you should become a volunteer mentor at CoderDojo Altona North. 

Whether you are a Python gun, can write HTML blindfolded, or love tinkering with hardware like Raspberry Pis or Arduinos or love tinkering with home built robots, your knowledge and experience would be welcome at our sessions! However, you don’t necessarily need to be a coding rockstar to help us out. Even if you can just give a hand with the organising, and general running of the dojo, then we’d still love to hear from you. You just need to be cool, great at supporting kids, and passionate. That’s all we ask for!

You’ll need a [Working With Children Check](http://www.workingwithchildren.vic.gov.au/), if you’d like to become a mentor with us. The application is free when it’s for volunteering purposes, and once you submit your form at the post office then you’re good to go – you don’t have to wait for the card to be posted out to you.

Finally, we don’t expect our volunteer mentors to attend each and every session. All we ask for is a few hours of your time each week when the dojo is running. If you can’t make a session, then that’s no problem! We’re operate a fun, relaxed, and flexible model for our awesome mentors! 

If this sounds like something you’d love to do, then what are you waiting for! Drop us a note at volunteer-at-coderdojo at practicalperformanceanalyst dot com and let's get the next generation of kids hacking.
