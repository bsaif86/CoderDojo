Substitute the BBC µBit with the inventors kit for the Arduino
A modified plate for the car enables mounting the inventor kit on the car base.

Lesson plans should link to BBC or related content. Making something from little things around the house like cardbaord, alfoil helps link the programming to the outcome.

Aliexpress has the devices we are seeking, but take about 30-40 days to arrive (cheapest cost per unit), some have free shipping, some don't.

- Conductors and Insulators (there is a conductive ink pen which leads to interesting application of pen and paper)
- Current and Voltage - explained using water pressure/flow to visualise what is happening - stick with Direct Current
