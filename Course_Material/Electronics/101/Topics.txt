## Topics - Electronics 101

- Conductors and Insulators (there is a conductive ink pen which leads to interesting application of pen and paper)
- Current and Voltage - explained using water pressure/flow to visualise what is happening - stick with Direct Current
- Passive components Resistors - simple circuits, voltage and current experiments - basic Ohms law
- Batteries and energy storage
- Magnetism and Electricity (suggested experiments with simple electromagnets)
- Passive components Capacitor, Inductors
- Analogue and Digital electronics
- Active Components diodes, transistors and IC's
